# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
    # The command cd ~/Desktop with no tags or descriptors attached would send you directly to the desktop.
# 2) What does ~/ mean?
    # ~ means the entire drive in which you are working from in your terminal, like C: on Windows.
# 3) What's the difference between an absolute and a relative path in your terminal?
    # An absolute path to a directory runs from your root directory, whilst a relative path is calculated from the current working directory.
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
    # Calling cd without any other modifiers would bring you back to your home directory.
# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do?
    # Calling rm ./ deletes every file and directory within and under your current working directory.
# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
    # It does nothing, since I am not in the directory with git functionality enabled, /elliot_decal. 
# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
    # The message that appears is "fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git", which is telling me that I cannot use git functions 
    # in this directory because it is not a git repository.
# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
    # The most frustrating bug or error I've encountered in this class so far was when I tried to link my directory to github, and I troubleshooted and resolved
    # it by creating a new directory and activating github in there instead, which worked somehow.  
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
    # Cloning a repository is essentially copying the entire contents of that repository onto your computer, while pulling from a repository merely updates the 
    # contents to the most recent published version.
# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
    # I really like reading about nuclear astrophysics, nucleosynthesis and nuclear fusion.
